        "On January 28th, 1986, seven astronauts perished when the Challenger shuttle erupted into a fireball merely 73 seconds after liftoff. The main cause was the failure of two rubber seals, called O-rings, that allowed fluid to leak and set fire, resulting in the explosion of the fuel-bearing boosters. The resiliency of these O-rings degrades with temperature. The day before launch, engineers raised alarms about the potential failure of these O-rings given previous data and the launch conditions but management refused to listen. The following data were reported to Congress in their investigation, they are real data from test launches and experiments. From this data and the expected temperature on launch day, you must make the executive decision of whether the space shuttle Challenger should be launched or aborted."
