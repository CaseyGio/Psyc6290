# **Psyc 6290: Research Statistics**  

Welcome to professor Casey Giordano's GitHub repository for **Psyc 6290: Research Statistics**! This repository contains datasets, R code, demonstrations, activities, and assignments to support your learning in statistical methods using **R** within the **Google Colab environment**.  

## 📂 **Repository Structure**  

- **📁 Datasets/** – Contains `.csv` files used for demonstrations, activities, and assignments.  
- **📁 WkX/** – Each week’s folder (e.g., `Wk2/` for Week 2) contains:  
  - Demonstrations (`.ipynb` Jupyter notebooks)  
  - Activities (`.ipynb` Jupyter notebooks)  
  - Assignments (most weeks include at least one assignment, also in `.ipynb` format)  

## 🛠 **Tools & Technologies**  

- **R programming language** (executed within Jupyter notebooks)  
- **Google Colab** (to run `.ipynb` notebooks)
